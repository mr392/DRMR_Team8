## **Repository**

In Git, a repository (also known as a "repo") is a storage space for a development project that contains all of a project's files, as well as a record of each file's revision history.

Through the use of Git repositories, multiple developers can work on a project at the same time - Git lets users create their own personal copies of a project's main repository, edit files indepedently of each other, monitor the updates done by coworkers in other repositories, and merge their separate work into a single version of the project.

Example:

Issue the command "git init" to initialize empty Git repository.

## **Clone**

A clone is a copy of a repository that a user downloads directly onto their computer, and "cloning" is the act of making that copy.

When a developer clones a repository onto their local drive, they can work on their files independently of Github and without having to use the internet. However, the cloned repository is still connected to the remote version, and can be used to push or pull changes to and from the remote whenever its developer goes back online.

**Source:** [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:

Issue the command followed by the remote repository URL:

## **Fork**

A fork is a personal copy of one user's repository that another user has transferred to their own account, and "forking" is the act of making this copy.

Forks enable developers to edit a project without making changes to the original repository. Forked repositories are still connected, however - changes can be compared across forks and pull requests can be created between them.

**Source:** [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example: Forked repository in GitHub:

## **Branch**

A branch is a secondary version of a user's repository that has diverged from the primary version, or "master" branch.

While a branch is contained within the whole repository along with the master, changes made to a branch do not impact the master, or any other branches - enabling a developer to work on one without disrupting another. Branches can also be made to merge back into the master, combining several different repositories into one single version.

**Source:** [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:

Issue the command followed by the branch name:

![branch example](/images/branch_example.png)


## **Commit**

A commit, also known as a revision, is a single change to a file, or set of files.

Each commit that a developer makes is recorded and assigned a commit message that the user types to describe the details of the change. Commits, and their descriptions, allow developers to keep track of the changes made to projects over time.

**Source:** [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:

Issue the command followed by the commit message:

![commit example](/images/commit_example.png)


## **Merge**

Merging takes the changes from one branch and combines them into another branch.

Merging can be done to branches either within the same repository or between two connected forks. Merges are frequently done through a pull request on Github or via a computer terminal's command line.

**Source:** [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:

Issue the command followed by branch name to be merged:

![show example](/images/merge_example.png)
  
  
## **Checkout**

The act of moving between or creating working branches. If a branch is already created,
it allows to switch to that branch leaving the checked-in branch untouched. 
Usually this is the master branch. The -b parameter creates the branch at checkout. Saving a command.


**Source:** [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:

Issue the command followed by the branch name:

> git checkout [branch name]

![checkout example](/images/checkout_example.PNG)


## **Master Branch**

The default development branch. 
Whenever you create a Git repository, a branch named "master" is created, and becomes the active branch. 
In most cases, this contains the local development branch.

**Source:** [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example:
Issue the command:

> git checkout master

to move to the main branch.

## **Pull**

Git pull refers to pulling down changeds and merging them wiht your local copy of the repository. 

**Source:** [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)

Example: 

Issue the command:

> git pull

![pull example](/images/pull_example.PNG)


## **Push**

Push sends the changes to a remote repository. This is done after the changes are comittedted locally. 


**Source:** [GitHub glossary](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary)


Example:

Issue the command followed by the branch name:

> git push 

![push example](/images/push_example.PNG)



# Defintions applicable to remote repositories

## **Add**

Used to add the origin of a git repository after specifying the URL 

**Source:** [git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote)

Example: 
Issue the command:

> git remote add origin "https://github.com/user/repo.git" 

![Remote add example](/images/remote_add.PNG)

## **Remove**

Removes the named remote-tracking branches and configuration settings. In the case of services like GitHub it does not delete the repository.
Just the local link pointing to it.

**Source:** [git reference](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/adding-a-remote)


Example:
Issue the command:

> git remote remove origin  

![remove example](/images/remove_example.PNG)

This will remove the file named "file.txt".

## **Show**

Gives various information about the commit tree.

**Source:** [git reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote)

Example:
Issue the command:

> git show 

The default shows the log of "HEAD"

![show example](/images/show_example.PNG)


## **Status**

Displays differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit. 


**Source:** [git status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status)


Example:
Issue the command:

> git status  

![status example](/images/status_example.PNG)
